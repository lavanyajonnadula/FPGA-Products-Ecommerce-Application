    <p><b>FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) boards are reconfigurable digital logic devices used for custom hardware development.<br>
       They contain logic blocks and interconnects that can be programmed to perform complex functions.<br>
       Developers use HDLs like Verilog or VHDL to define the hardware behavior.<br>
       FPGAs are widely used in embedded systems, signal processing, and communication protocols.<br>
       They enable parallel processing, making them faster than microcontrollers for certain tasks.<br>
       FPGAs are ideal for prototyping digital circuits, allowing hardware changes without manufacturing.<br>
       Common applications include image processing, robotics, cryptography, and custom processors.<br>
       In real-time, FPGAs are used in aerospace, automotive (ADAS systems), and medical devices.<br>
       They are also critical in 5G base stations, IoT edge devices, and high-frequency trading systems.<br>
       Popular boards like Zybo Z7, DE10-Nano, and Basys 3 support both academic learning and industrial projects.<br></b>
